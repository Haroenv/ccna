# CCNA Summary

A summary of all commands useable in CCNA 1 and 2.

# Development

The summary itself is written in Markdown in the [index.md](index.md) file. To view the site you'll need to install jekyll`:

```
gem install jekyll
```

which might require `ruby` to be installed, refer to [rubyinstaller.org](http://rubyinstaller.org).

Serving the site is done by `jekyll s`, after which it's available at [localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000), or `jekyll b` and then it's available in the `_site` directory.

Style is written in `scss`.
